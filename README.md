## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Although a simple project, it is very useful for reinforcing knowledge of HTML and CSS file structures and how to link different files.

In this project it was also good to reinforce the use of HTML tags and CSS properties, especially in this project the use of the Flexbox property.

### Continued development

I've noticed that it will be very good to continue practicing the organization and alignment of components on web pages.
